GAN for Generating Realistic Fake Images
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can generate realistic fake images based on the source data.

Data Preparation
The data used in this project underwent the following preprocessing steps to ensure optimal training conditions for the GAN:

Resized: All images were resized to ensure uniform input dimensions.
Center-cropped: Images were center-cropped to focus on the main subject and remove unnecessary borders.
Normalized: Pixel values were normalized to scale them between -1 and 1, which is essential for stabilizing and improving the training process.
Model Architecture
The GAN network consists of two main components:

Generator: This model generates fake images from random noise using a series of convolutional layers.
Discriminator: This model, also built with convolutional layers, distinguishes between real and generated images.
Training
The model was trained for 30 epochs. Throughout the training process, the generator learned to produce realistic fake images that closely resemble the source data, while the discriminator improved its ability to distinguish between real and fake images.

Results
After 30 epochs of training, the GAN successfully generated realistic fake images. The model's performance can be further improved with additional training and fine-tuning.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
